        <p>
            Fiona Apples and Oranges is the hottest of hot takes – a talk and music show with discussions about pop media, music groups, and how everything worth mentioning is because of Mitski’s Scorpio rising placement. With guests, music recs, and lively talk, this show is everything the soul needs – or maybe it’s just some nice white noise.
